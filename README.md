# pong
** pong a classical game that programmed in 8086 assembly language.**

_I followed https://github.com/programmingdimension/8086-Assembly-Pong and Programming Dimension's pong video series for educational purposes. Here, I apply a major change using two-color ball instead of a single ball. And some minor changes in speed, dimension, menu, and so on._
