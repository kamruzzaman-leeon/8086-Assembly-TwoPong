# pingpong
 pingpong a classical game that programmed in 8086 assembly language.

I followed https://github.com/programmingdimension/8086-Assembly-Pong and
Programming Dimension's pong video series for educational purpose.
here I applied a major change using 2 color ball instead of single ball
and some minor change in speed,dimension,manu and so on.
